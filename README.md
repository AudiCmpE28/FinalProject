#Application Structure#
App.js|
    -> app
      -> screens
        -> cameraScreen.js
        -> HomeScreen.js
        -> ResultScreen.js
        -> ResultScreen.js
        -> TestScreen.js
        -> WelcomeScreen.js
        

App.js creates a stack of all the screens so that all screens can navigate to 
eachother. Once the main file of App.js executes, it will redirect to the
WelcomeScreen.js which will redirect the user to the HomeScreen.js. From there, 
the user could choose to use camera or phone gallery to get results to buy
the same item or similar while also identifying the result. User is also able to 
see recent searches in the home screen which could be deleted or able to see
the results again.
